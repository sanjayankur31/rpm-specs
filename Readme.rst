This repository holds various rpm spec files that I'm working on. As they are
completed, and the package submitted for review for inclusion in Fedora, I'll
remove the branch here. If you're looking to get some software included in
Fedora, feel free to contact me. If I can't do it myself, I'll be able to help
with the packaging bit.
