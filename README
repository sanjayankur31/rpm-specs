 Not all the spec files included are complete.

- Ones that have passed review are complete and function as per the fedora packaging guidelines
- Ones that are still in review might change as the reviewer points out issues
- Ones that are still in progress need more work done. These are paused generally because I'm in dialogue with upstream over some build issue. 

Please refer to http://dodoincfedora.wordpress.com/2011/08/20/fedora-gsoc-report/ for information on the spec status.


Only spec files are included here. The srpms would be very large (since they include all the project source codes along with patches and other additions)
